Install Steem : http://steem.atari.st/

Place the contents of this folder on the emulated hard drive "hard_drv".
The easiest way to d othis is to create a folder called "hard_drv" on the pc and place this folder in it.
In steem either during setup, or during emulation you can set the hard drivweto be the hard_drv folder you created.
To do this, click on the disks icon on the nav and click on the Hard Drive button. Browse and select this folder.

Load up steam with out any disks in any drives and opne up the hard drive when the tos desktop opens.
Open the Zamboozal folder and double click on the zamgame.prg file.

Some of the digital sounds are off, but the game seems to work fine (if a little slow).

I know the game works with tos102us.img, so I have included it in this archive.
