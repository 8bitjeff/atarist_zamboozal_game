# How to emulate with Steem (or use this idea for your favotite platform and emulator
Install Steem : http://steem.atari.st/

Place the contents of this folder on the emulated hard drive "hard_drv".
The easiest way to d othis is to create a folder called "hard_drv" on the pc and place this folder in it.
In steem either during setup, or during emulation you can set the hard drivweto be the hard_drv folder you created.
To do this, click on the disks icon on the nav and click on the Hard Drive button. Browse and select this folder.

Load up steam with out any disks in any drives and opne up the hard drive when the tos desktop opens.
Open the Zamboozal folder and double click on the zamgame.prg file.

Some of the digital sounds are off, but the game seems to work fine (if a little slow).

I know the game works with tos102us.img, so I have included it in this archive.

   Zamboozal Poker Dice Instructions

Overview
     Zamboozal Poker Dice is a game of skill and chance that is 
based on the old game Yahtzee, but with a few twists.  If you've 
played Yahtzee, then you know the basic rules, but there are 
differences which we will explain next.  If you haven't played 
Yahtzee then the entire game will be explained later.
The main differences are:
               (1)New catagories;
                    *one pair
                    *two pair
                    *2nd Zamboozal
                    *Blackjack
               (2)Wild Play
                    * one chance per game to get a special bonus
               (3)All digitized sound
               (4)Special animated rewards

Rules
     The title screen will instruct you to press the mouse button 
to begin the game.  If you don't, the game will cycle through the 
title screen and the high score screen.
     The first question asked is whether you want one or two 
players, choose one or the other.  The computer will ask you to 
confirm your decision in case you make a mistake.

ROLLING THE DICE

     The computer will now instruct you to press the roll button 
to roll the dice.  Place the mouse pointer on the button and press 
the left button.  Animated dice will roll through the message box, 
and then five dice will appear at the top with the screen 
accompanied by a rolling sound.  These dice are the heart of the 
whole game.  You will get three rolls and will attempt to make 
poker hands with the dice to score points.   
     The ultimate objective is to score as many points as possible 
and and beat the high score to become king.  The best poker hand 
you can get is five of the same dice, this is called a Zamboozal.  
Zamboozal's score the highest amount of points and get the best 
animated rewards.
     When you roll, the five dice will appear in numerical order.
If have a good hand, then press on the Stay button and then click 
on the category of your choice.  You can only click on each 
category once, and if your hand doesn't adhere to the 
specifications of the category then your score will be zero and 
the the computer will salute you with a groan.

RE-ROLL
     If you don't like some or all of your dice, you have two 
opportunities to re-roll some or all of the dice.  To do this, 
click on the dice you want to re-roll.  The die should change 
into a colourful block.  You can change as many dice as you want 
to.  If you make a mistake and change a die you don't want to 
change, just click on it again, and it will change back to it's 
original die.  When you are sure of your choice, click on roll.


     The number of your roll is displayed below the roll button.  
When this reaches three, you will not be able to roll again and 
the message box will instruct you too click on a category or Wild 
Play.  Wild Play will be explained later.
     Be sure you click on the category that you want, but if you 
don't, the computer always gives you a chance to change your mind.

CATAGORIES

The first six catagories are for multiples of the same die.
     Aces: if you click here, all the dice that display a one will 
be tallied and and recorded on your score.  The top score is 5, one 
for each die.
     Deuces:if you click here, all the dice that display a two 
will be tallied and recorded to your score.  The top score is 10, 
two for each die.
     Threes, Fours, Fives, and Sixes all adhere to the same rules 
above.  The top score of threes is 15, of fours is 20, fives is 25 
and sixes is 30.
     Bonus Points: if the total of all your scores in the first six 
catagories is above 63, then you will receive a 35 point bonus to 
your top score.
      
     One Pair: If you have two dice that are the same, then click 
here and receive 10 points.

     Two pair:If you have two sets of dice that are the same, or 
four dice that are the same then click here and receive 20 points.

     3 of a Kind:If you have 3 dice that are all the same, click 
here and receive the total of all the dice.  The dice total is 
displayed in a box under the dice.

     4 of a Kind:If you have 3 dice that are all the same, click 
here and receive the total of all the dice.  The dice total is 
displayed in a box under the dice.

     Full house:If you have 3 dice that are the same # and and two 
dice that are the same # then click on this category and receive 
25 points.  An example of this would be like this:
            Dice: 2  2  2  3  3

     Small Straight: If you have four dice that are all in 
succession, for example 1 2 3 4, or 2 3 4 5, or 3 4 5 6 , then 
click here and receive 30 points.

     Large Straight: If you have all five dice in succession, for 
example, 1 2 3 4 5, or 2 3 4 5 6, then click here and receive 40 
points.

     Zamboozal: The ultimate category! If all five dice are the 
same, then click here and receive 50 points plus the total of the 
dice.  For example, if you have all fives, then you receive 75 
points, if you have all sixes, then you receive 80 points.

     2nd Zamboozal: If you have already gotten one Zamboozal, and 


get another one, then click here and receive 100 points, plus the 
total of all the dice.

     Chance:when you are in a bind and can't put your dice on any 
of the catagories, then use this category.  If you click on 
Chance, you will receive the total of all the dice.

     Blackjack:This category is different from all the others.  
The object here is to get as close to 21 on the dice total as 
possible with out going over.  The dice total is displayed in a 
box below the dice.  If your total is 21, then you automatically 
get Blackjack and receive 45 points.  If your total is below 21, 
then the computer will roll his dice.  If the computer's dice 
total is less than your's, you win and get 45 points.  If the 
computer's dice total is above 21, then you win and receive 45 points.  
If the computer's dice total is above your's, but below 21, then 
you lose.  If your dice total is above 21, you lose.  If you lose, 
you simply get 0 points

Wild Play

     If you are stuck and need a chance, then there is an option 
for you, the Wild Play.  Click on the spinning Z and the computer 
will cycle through the 4 possible outcomes.  When the Cycling is 
finished, the outcome will flash on the screen.  The four outcomes 
are:
     (1)+5 to top: This gives you 5 points added to your total of 
the first 6 dice.  This will help if you are below 63 and need 
more points to get the bonus.
     (2)+10 to total: This scores 10 extra points to your 
final score.
     (3)Re-Roll!: This is the outcome that you want most.  If you 
get it, then you get your entire turn over.
     (4)Zilch!: This nets you absolutely nothing!

     You can only use Wild Play once per game, per player.  
     Wild Play is completely independent of your turn.  If you get 
plus 5, plus 10, or zilch, then you still have to click on a 
category.
